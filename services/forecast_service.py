"""
services/forecast_service.py

Load a no-lag linear model trained on weather features only, fetch a 48-hour
weather forecast from Open-Meteo, and produce hourly wind/solar predictions.

Why no-lag?  The lag model (with lag1 as a feature) achieves high historical
R² because the previous hour's actual value is a strong predictor of the
current hour.  But when used recursively for future forecasting each predicted
value becomes the next step's lag, causing two failure modes:
  • Solar drifts upward indefinitely (the intercept term accumulates).
  • Wind can collapse to 0 and get stuck (lag=0 → next lag=0, indefinitely).

The no-lag model uses only weather variables (windspeed, cloudcover,
shortwave_radiation, etc.) which are available from the forecast API and have
a direct physical relationship with generation.  shortwave_radiation = 0 at
night guarantees solar predictions are naturally near-zero overnight.
